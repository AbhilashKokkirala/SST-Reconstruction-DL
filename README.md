The sea surface temperature is an important factor in determining the air-sea interaction, thereby affecting numerical weather prediction. Thermal fronts are sharp boundaries between water at two different temperatures. We will first discuss the importance of thermal fronts for Climate Scientists. Then we will understand some fundamental physics understanding of it. Later the methods to detect them are discussed. Finally comparing it with in-situ data.

## Thermal Fronts
Thermal fronts are boundaries separating cold and warm water. These fronts range from a few meters to hundreds of kilometres. The shorter scale dynamics influence the turbulence cascade of the ocean. The larger fronts affect even the top of the atmospheric boundary layer. Thermal fronts have current flowing along the boundaries thus causing the tracer to concentrate along them (attracting or repelling LCS). Thus thermal fronts accumulate huge amounts of phytoplankton along them and are well-mixed due to upwelling. These attract fish to the thermal fronts, a potential zone for fishing. 

## Physics
There are three dominant forces on the ocean - Gravitational force, force from pressure and Coriolis force.
